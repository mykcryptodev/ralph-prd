# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create skill directory structure
- What was implemented:
  - Created `.claude/skills/ralph/` directory structure
  - Added placeholder `prd.md` skill file with frontmatter
- Files changed:
  - `.claude/skills/ralph/prd.md` (new)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - This is a pure markdown skill repo - no TypeScript/Node.js
  - Skill files use YAML frontmatter for metadata (name, description)
  - The prd.md file needs full implementation in US-002
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Create the /prd skill definition file
- What was implemented:
  - Full PRD generation skill with comprehensive instructions
  - 4-step process: gather context, generate PRD, guidelines, after-creation steps
  - Example PRD output for user authentication feature
  - Proper frontmatter with name and description triggers
- Files changed:
  - `.claude/skills/ralph/prd.md` (updated with full implementation)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Skill files are markdown with YAML frontmatter
  - The description field in frontmatter should include trigger phrases
  - No tests to run - this is a pure markdown skill repo
  - Claude Code loads skills from `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/` directories
---

## Iteration 3 - US-003: Add ralph.sh setup logic to skill
- What was implemented:
  - Added Step 4 to prd.md skill for ralph.sh setup
  - Skill now checks if ralph.sh exists in project root on invocation
  - If missing, creates ralph.sh with full autonomous loop script and chmod +x
  - If exists, prompts user "Would you like to overwrite?" before replacing
  - Renumbered "After PRD Creation" to Step 5
- Files changed:
  - `.claude/skills/ralph/prd.md` (added ralph.sh setup logic)
  - `PRD.md` (marked US-003 acceptance criteria complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Skills can instruct Claude to create files with specific content
  - The embedded ralph.sh script contains the full Ralph agent prompt
  - Important to provide clear user prompts for file overwrite scenarios
---

## Iteration 4 - US-004: Include progress.txt template in skill
- What was implemented:
  - Added Step 3 to prd.md skill for progress.txt creation
  - Template includes "# Progress Log", "## Learnings" section header, and separator
  - Skill preserves existing progress.txt if it already exists (don't overwrite)
  - Renumbered Steps 3-5 to Steps 4-6
- Files changed:
  - `.claude/skills/ralph/prd.md` (added progress.txt template creation)
  - `PRD.md` (marked US-004 acceptance criteria complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - The progress.txt Learnings section is read first by Ralph each iteration
  - Important to NOT overwrite existing progress.txt to preserve learnings
  - Step numbering needs to be updated when inserting new steps
---

## Iteration 5 - US-005: Create installation README
- What was implemented:
  - Comprehensive README.md with installation steps, usage examples, and troubleshooting
  - Includes: Prerequisites, Installation, Usage, What Gets Created, How Ralph Works
  - PRD format documentation and tips for best results
  - Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Files changed:
  - `README.md` (new - 150+ lines of documentation)
  - `PRD.md` (marked US-005 acceptance criteria complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - This is a pure markdown repo - no tests/typecheck to run
  - README should cover both global (~/.claude/skills/) and project-level (.claude/skills/) installation
  - Include troubleshooting for common issues (permissions, skill not found)
---

## Iteration 6 - US-006: Add AGENTS.md with skill patterns
- What was implemented:
  - Created comprehensive AGENTS.md documenting skill patterns
  - Documented project structure and file organization
  - Explained skill file structure conventions (location, frontmatter, body)
  - Documented ralph.sh script purpose, key parameters, and location
  - Explained how Claude Code loads skills from directories
  - Added common patterns section (file creation, progress tracking, committing)
  - Added contributing guidelines
- Files changed:
  - `AGENTS.md` (new - comprehensive patterns documentation)
  - `PRD.md` (marked US-006 acceptance criteria complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - AGENTS.md should capture reusable patterns, not task-specific details
  - This completes the PRD - all user stories are now implemented
  - Pure markdown repo requires no tests/typecheck
