# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create plugin manifest structure
- What was implemented: Created the `.claude-plugin/` directory with `plugin.json` manifest
- Files changed:
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (created)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Plugin manifest goes in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at project root
  - Required fields: name, version, description, author, homepage, repository
  - Skills should go in `skills/` at project root, NOT inside `.claude-plugin/`
  - JSON validation with `python3 -c "import json; json.load(...)"` works for quick syntax check
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Restructure skill for plugin format
- What was implemented: Created `skills/prd/` directory at project root and copied SKILL.md there
- Files changed:
  - `skills/prd/SKILL.md` (created - copied from `.claude/skills/prd/SKILL.md`)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Plugin skills go in `skills/` at project root, NOT inside `.claude-plugin/`
  - Skill filename must be SKILL.md (case-sensitive)
  - Frontmatter must have `name` and `description` fields
  - The old `.claude/skills/prd/` location will be cleaned up in US-006
  - When plugin is loaded, skill is namespaced as `/ralph-prd:prd`
---

## Iteration 3 - US-003: Bundle ralph.sh as plugin asset
- What was implemented: Created scripts/ directory and copied ralph.sh there, updated SKILL.md with usage instructions
- Files changed:
  - `scripts/ralph.sh` (created - copied from root `ralph.sh`)
  - `skills/prd/SKILL.md` (updated - added "Running the Ralph Loop" section)
  - `PRD.md` (updated - marked US-003 complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Plugin bundled scripts go in `scripts/` at project root
  - Users install from `~/.claude/plugins/ralph-prd/scripts/ralph.sh`
  - Bash syntax check: `bash -n script.sh`
  - No typecheck needed for markdown/shell projects - just verify syntax
