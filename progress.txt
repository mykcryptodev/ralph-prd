# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create plugin manifest structure
- What was implemented: Created the `.claude-plugin/` directory with `plugin.json` manifest
- Files changed:
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (created)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Plugin manifest goes in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at project root
  - Required fields: name, version, description, author, homepage, repository
  - Skills should go in `skills/` at project root, NOT inside `.claude-plugin/`
  - JSON validation with `python3 -c "import json; json.load(...)"` works for quick syntax check
