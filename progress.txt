# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create skill directory structure
- What was implemented:
  - Created `.claude/skills/ralph/` directory structure
  - Added placeholder `prd.md` skill file with frontmatter
- Files changed:
  - `.claude/skills/ralph/prd.md` (new)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - This is a pure markdown skill repo - no TypeScript/Node.js
  - Skill files use YAML frontmatter for metadata (name, description)
  - The prd.md file needs full implementation in US-002
---

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Create the /prd skill definition file
- What was implemented:
  - Full PRD generation skill with comprehensive instructions
  - 4-step process: gather context, generate PRD, guidelines, after-creation steps
  - Example PRD output for user authentication feature
  - Proper frontmatter with name and description triggers
- Files changed:
  - `.claude/skills/ralph/prd.md` (updated with full implementation)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Skill files are markdown with YAML frontmatter
  - The description field in frontmatter should include trigger phrases
  - No tests to run - this is a pure markdown skill repo
  - Claude Code loads skills from `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/` directories
