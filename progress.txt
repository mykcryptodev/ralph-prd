# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Patterns discovered during implementation)

## Iteration 1 - US-001: Create skill directory structure
- What was implemented:
  - Created `.claude/skills/ralph/` directory structure
  - Added placeholder `prd.md` skill file with frontmatter
- Files changed:
  - `.claude/skills/ralph/prd.md` (new)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - This is a pure markdown skill repo - no TypeScript/Node.js
  - Skill files use YAML frontmatter for metadata (name, description)
  - The prd.md file needs full implementation in US-002
